# Guernsey example application - Template Demo

The template demo application demonstrates a slightly more complex use
of templates, with a fake database table and examples of how this can
be shown on a web page using a template, as well as how to format it
as JSON and CSV. This includes an example of the mechanism to enable
an additional media type producer for a resource.

To run it, make sure you are in your virtual environment. Also make
sure that you have the Cheetah template engine installed (should be
installed if you followed example 2). Then go to the application
directory and start the application:

```
./bin/template-demo.py --log-level-console=DEBUG
```

Try visiting `http://localhost:8080/` in your web browser. It should
show a simple web page with a title and today's date. The title and
the date are provided as key/value pairs to the template engine and
the rest is provided as a Cheetah template. This is just as in example
2.

But now the page also contains a link to a resource called
`/cities/`. This resource is implemented by the `CitiesResource` class,
and contains a small dictionary to emulate a table fetched from a
database. Depending on the media type requested, this table can be
formatted into HTML, JSON or CSV format. Try clicking the link in your
web browser. This should show a short table with a few cities and the
countries they are located in.

Now, if you take a look into the templates directory, you will notice
that the two template files have file names matching the class name of
the resource class. This is the default behavior, but it can be
overridden by calling the `self.fillTemplate()` method (which
optionally takes a `templateFile` parameter) from the `getHtml()`
method, instead of just returning the template model. If this is used,
the processed template string returned from `self.fillTemplate()`
should be returned from the `getHtml()` method, thus bypassing any
later template processing. The specified template file must exist on
the template search path (which can be specified as a command-line
option), or a `MissingTemplateError` exception will be raised.

We have now established that `getHtml()` can return either a model
object, which is processed in the templating system, or a string,
which will be passed directly to the client. There is a third option,
and that is to return the special constant
`twisted.web.server.NOT_DONE_YET`. This is used for deferred
responses, where the result cannot be immediately delivered to the
client. This may happen if the response needs to be produced by
contacting an external web service, a database server or by running an
external command.

Since these operations may block waiting for a response to be
delivered, they must be handled in a way that does not block the
reactor, since that would completely negate the advantages of using an
event-based programming framework like Twisted. More on this in a
later example.

Now, to get back on the main track, go to a terminal, and run
the following command:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: application/json,*/*;q=0.5" http://localhost:8080/cities/
```

This will produce a couple of HTTP headers as well as a JSON object
representing the cities table. Now run the following command:

```
curl -i -H "Accept: text/csv,*/*;q=0.5" http://localhost:8080/cities/
```

This should produce the cities table formatted as CSV.
